Hi, my name is Irina, a Bulgarian who spent childhood years in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany's northernmost state.\
As a teenager I was already reading in three languages as well as diving deep into Jim Morrison's poetry.\
At present, I do quite exciting stuff with the help of Python and Data Science.
