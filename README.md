## Creativity Booth
Hi, my name is Irina 📘 I'm writing texts in 3 human languages and 1 programming language 🖋️ The programming language I use is Python for Data Scientists which code is fast and compact.

Jupyter Notebook is the most amazing notebook I have ever written in! No pages, no borders, just flow... You know, the Creativity Research Lab at Drexel University reveals that the creative flow state involves two key factors: extensive experience, which leads to a network of brain areas specialized for generating the desired type of ideas, plus the release of control (letting go) to allow this network to work with little or no conscious supervision.

Typically, we are advised to write down every idea before it's gone. My ideas hop impatiently through my mind until they take their proper place. My native language is Bulgarian, went to Grund- and Realschule in Schleswig-Holstein, studied English in Oxford, exploring Latin and Japanese as a hobby.

I've decided to invest my knowledge in Bulgaria, where my great-grandfathers owned land, my grandfathers owned land, my father owns land and I own land. I'll work only for a Bulgarian company.
