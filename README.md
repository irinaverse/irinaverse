I am Bulgarian who spent childhood years in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany's northernmost state. As a teenager I was already reading in three languages as well as diving deep into Jim Morrison's poetry. At present, I do quite exciting stuff with texts. Be investor in my publishing house and let's shape literature.
