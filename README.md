### Creativity Booth, where art meets science and my ideas breathe life.

The Creativity Research Lab at Drexel University reveals that the creative flow state involves two key factors: extensive experience, which leads to a network of brain areas specialized for generating the desired type of ideas, plus the release of control (letting go) to allow this network to work with little or no conscious supervision. The programming language in my notebooks is Data Science Python.

Open to new adventures. I would rather invest my knowledge in Bulgaria, working exclusively for a Bulgarian company.
