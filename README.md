My name is Irina, a Bulgarian who spent childhood years in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany's northernmost state. As a teenager I was already reading in three languages as well as diving deep into Jim Morrison's poetry. At present, I do quite exciting stuff with texts - have 2 books ready (working on the 3rd) and a business plan. The books are designed for people on the move. I need 10K startup capital. Please, be investor in my publishing house and let's shape literature.
