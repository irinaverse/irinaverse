## Creativity Booth
Hi, my name is Irina. I write in 3 human languages and 1 programming language. The programming language I use is Python for Data Scientists which code is fast and compact. After my 2 years Artificial Intelligence education, I feel more human than ever.

Jupyter Notebook is the most amazing notebook I have ever written in! No pages, no borders, just flow... You know, the Creativity Research Lab at Drexel University reveals that the creative flow state involves two key factors: extensive experience, which leads to a network of brain areas specialized for generating the desired type of ideas, plus the release of control (letting go) to allow this network to work with little or no conscious supervision.

My native language is Bulgarian, went to Grund- and Realschule in Schleswig-Holstein, studied English in Oxford.

I've decided to invest my knowledge in Bulgaria, working exclusively for a Bulgarian company.
