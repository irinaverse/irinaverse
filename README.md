## Creativity Booth
Dancing with words and numbers. Jupyter Notebook is the most amazing tool I have ever written in! No pages, no borders, just flow... You know, the Creativity Research Lab at Drexel University reveals that the creative flow state involves two key factors: extensive experience, which leads to a network of brain areas specialized for generating the desired type of ideas, plus the release of control (letting go) to allow this network to work with little or no conscious supervision. The programming language in my notebooks is Python for Data Scientists which code is fast and compact.

I would rather invest my knowledge in Bulgaria, working exclusively for a Bulgarian company. Open to new adventures.
