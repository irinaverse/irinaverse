## Artificial Intelligence is not a task to solve, it is a World to be experienced
Usually, we are advised to write down every idea before it's gone. My ideas hop impatiently through my mind until they take their proper place. I'm fascinated by space and time, words and numbers, metaphysics and robotics. My native language is Bulgarian, went to Grund- and Realschule in Schleswig-Holstein, studied English in Oxford, exploring Latin and Japanese as a hobby.

The programming language I use is Python for Data Scientists which code is fast and compact.

Looking forward to do great things in a working environment!
