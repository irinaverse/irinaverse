## Creativity Booth
Intuitive Introvert, writing texts in 3 human languages and 1 programming language. The programming language I use is Python for Data Scientists which code is fast and compact. Typically, we are advised to write down every idea before it's gone. My ideas hop impatiently through my mind until they take their proper place. I'm fascinated by space and time, words and numbers, metaphysics and robotics. My native language is Bulgarian, went to Grund- and Realschule in Schleswig-Holstein, studied English in Oxford, exploring Latin and Japanese as a hobby.

Jupyter Notebook is the most amazing notebook I have ever written in! No pages, no borders, just flow... The Creativity Research Lab at Drexel University reveals that the creative flow state involves two key factors:
- extensive experience, which leads to a network of brain areas specialized for generating the desired type of ideas
- plus, the release of control (letting go) to allow this network to work with little or no conscious supervision.
